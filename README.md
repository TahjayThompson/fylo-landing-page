# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this repo.

## The challenge

challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible with the feactures i like. 


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:
